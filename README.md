# PARKING-ALERT-SYSTEM-USING-ARDUINO
OBJECTIVE:
    Aims at providing a confusion free and easy parking. 
INTRODUCTION:
    This circuit system is to help the car driver to detect the availability of  space   while parking. This whole process includes the use of Arduino ,  Display and ultrasonic sensor.   A parking slot is a cleared area that is intended for parking vehicles. Usually, the term refers to a dedicated area that has been provided with a durable or semi durable surface.

    The main importance  of this project is to reduce the risk of finding the parking areas and to save the time of the user. It eliminates the unnecessary traveling of vehicles across the filled parking slots

COMPONENTS USED:
•	Arduino uno 
•	LCD display
•	Ultrasonic sensors
•	Potentiometer
•	Resistor
•	Power supply (Battery)
•	Breadboard
•	Connecting wires
•	Online simulator – TinkerCad.

CONCLUSION:
	The main contribution of study is to introduce the most significant parking problem that is finding vacant space in a parking area. It helps to give the proper management of parking. Parking detection system would decrease searching time for vacant slots. And therefore, it reduces the effort of the driver to find vacant slot. Thus using this project, car parking can be done more efficiently and easily than manual method.
